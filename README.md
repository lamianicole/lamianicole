## Hallo, my name is Lamia Nicole

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I offer you a glimpse into my coding journey.

From August 2024 to February 2025, I attended a full-time Frontend Developer Bootcamp, which involved numerous hands-on exercises and practical projects.

From Text Editor to Frontend Developer â€“ driven by curiosity, embracing challenges, and growing with every step. Passionate about fashion and design, with a sporty spirit that fuels my motivation and creativity in everything I do.

Enjoy exploring!


At the moment, Iâ€™m focused on applying and deepening the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained through smaller projects. This approach allows me to build confidence and refine my skills along the way.
